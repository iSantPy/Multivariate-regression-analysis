# Multivariate regression analysis
One of the most valuable tools for Data Scientists is Regression Analysis! With this model, we aim to figure out the relationship (if there is any)
between a variable called the target and other independent variables called the features vector.

In this case study, we are using data from different brands of cars and their features (such as engine size, maker, gas mileage in the city and highway, etc.)
to try to fit a multivariate regression model. I gained insights from the data by plotting different charts like boxplots,
violin plots, heatmaps, and computing a correlation matrix for every feature against the target variable (price).
